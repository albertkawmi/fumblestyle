### I'm fumbling around with stylesheets using Sass (SCSS) with Koala.

I find the idea of styleguides quite interesting. I am not a front-end developer, but this seems like the best way to start any serious project; create a single HTML page that contains all the different elements and design patterns that you'll use in a project. A thoroughly put-together styleguide allows you to see what impact your CSS changes have across all your design elements, saving you having to test against everything. (I guess...)
