### I'm fumbling around with CSS and Sass.

I am learning to use CSS with the Sass preprocessor (SCSS). So I created these basic patterns to style most commonly used HTML elements. The focus is on simplicity, whilst making sure that the elements look at least OK on both large and small screens. I've put this on Github too and welcome any feedback/criticism of these fumblings!
