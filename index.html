	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>I find the idea of styleguides quite interesting. I am not a front-end developer, but this seems like the best way to start any serious project; create a single HTML page that contains all the different elements and design patterns that you'll use in a project. A thoroughly put-together styleguide allows you to see what impact your CSS changes have across all your design elements, saving you having to test against everything. (I guess...)</p>

	<h2>Boxes in a row...</h2>
	<p>A very simply way of lining up boxes of content will suffice for most simple websites. These are divs are set to <code>display: inline-block;</code> with a media query to switch to block representation for smaller screens. The width is set as a percentage with margin also as a percentage.</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="box-3 pale-bg">Block 1 has just one sentence in it.</div>
		<div class="box-3 pale-bg">Block 2 has more than one sentence. In fact it has multiple sentences because we want this to be the tallest block, height-wise. Hopefully this will do the trick.</div>
		<div class="box-3 pale-bg">Block 3 has two sentences. It should be taller than block 1 but not block 3.</div>
	</div>
	<p>As a newcomer to web design, I have to say I am genuinely perplexed by how difficult it is to put text in boxes and place those boxes exactly how you want them. I know there are frameworks and grid patterns and so on and so forth. But it is remarkably complicated considering the task at hand. And I'm not trying to be dismissive of CSS; it's just that if I spend half an hour to place these three divs neatly in a line and turn to my wife to share this triumph, you can't blame her for looking at me like "wtf..?"</p>

	<h2>Images</h2>
	<p>I have set <code>img { width: 100%; }</code> as a default for responsive images. I imagine there will be more to it than this, but it should serve as a starting point so that if images are dropped into the page they don't look too bad on whatever screen size.</p>
	<img src="http://placekitten.com/300/100">
	<p>I love <a href="http://placehold.it">placehold.it</a> - a great service for dropping sizable placeholder images into your designs. But <a href="http://placekitten.com">placekitten.com</a> is better if you need kittens.</p>

	<h2>More Typography</h2>
	<p>This section showcases the remaining typography elements. Rather than reach for some lorem ipsum, I'll rattle off a few of them here... You've got the <code>&lt;code&gt; element</code>, the blockquote ...</p>
	<blockquote>"Life is a test. It is only a test."</blockquote>
	<p>What's going on here then?</p>
