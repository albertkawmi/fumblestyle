	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This seems like the best way to learn CSS: create a single HTML page that contains all the different elements and design patterns that you'll likely use in a web design project. I've put <a href="http://albertkawmi.github.io/fumblestyle/">this on Github</a> too and welcome any feedback/criticism of these fumblings!</p>
	<p>I'll link to tools, tutorials and relevant articles as I fumble along. The smily-face logo utilises the 'fontelico' font via <a href="http://weloveiconfonts.com/">weloveiconfonts.com</a> and I used <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">Adobe's colour wheel tool</a> to pick the colour scheme.</p>

	<h2>Images</h2>
	<p>I have set <code>img { width: 100%; }</code> as a default for responsive images. I imagine there will be more to it than this, but it should serve as a starting point so that if images are dropped into the page they don't look too bad on whatever screen size.</p>
	<img src="http://placekitten.com/300/100">
	<p>Thanks to <a href="http://placekitten.com">placekitten.com</a> for providing kitten placeholder images in any dimensions.</p>

	<h2>Boxes in a row</h2>
	<p>This is intended to be a simple structure for creating rows of boxes. These are divs are set to <code>display: inline-block;</code> with a media query to switch to block representation for smaller screens. The width is set as a percentage with margin also as a percentage.</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="box-33 pale-bg">Block 1 has just one sentence in it.</div>
		<div class="box-33 pale-bg">Block 2 has more than one sentence. In fact it has multiple sentences because we want this to be the tallest block, height-wise. Hopefully this will do the trick.</div>
		<div class="box-33 pale-bg">Block 3 has two sentences. It should be taller than block 1 but not block 3.</div>
	</div>
	<p>The above example was a row of three boxes which I gave the class name <code>.box-33</code>. The '33' represents the approximate width of the box depending on how many you want in a row. More classes have been added to allow for different layouts: <code>.box-25, .box-75, .box-66</code> and so on.</p>
	<p>Each row of boxes (annoyingly) has to be wrapped in a div that has the <code>.row { font-size: 0; }</code> class; one of the solutions from CSS-tricks for <a href="http://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/">how to fight unwanted gaps between inline-block elements</a>.</p>
	<P>There's a great tutorial at <a href="http://learnlayout.com/">learnlayout.com</a> which I found very useful as a newcomer.</P>

			<h2>A rant about boxes</h2>
			<p>I am  perplexed by how difficult it is to put text in boxes and place those boxes exactly how you want them. I know there are frameworks and grid patterns and so on and so forth. But it is remarkably complicated considering the task at hand. And I'm not trying to be dismissive of CSS; it's just that if I spend half an hour to place these three divs neatly in a line and turn to my wife to share this triumph, you can't blame her for looking at me like "wtf..?"</p>

			<h1>Heading 1</h1>
			<h2>Heading 2</h2>
			<h3>Heading 3</h3>
			<h4>Heading 4</h4>
			<h5>Heading 5</h5>
			<h6>Heading 6</h6>

	<h2>More Typography</h2>
	<p>This section showcases the remaining typography elements. Rather than reach for some lorem ipsum, I'll rattle off a few of them here... We've alrady had the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag and there's the<code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag for blocks of code:</p>
<pre>
function downloadCSV() {
	//join the CSV rows separated by a newline character
	var csvString = csvRows.join("\n");

	// create a blob for the CSV file and set the link href to point to that blob
	var blob = new Blob([csvString], {type: "text/css;charset=utf-8"});
	var a = document.getElementById('csv-link');
	a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);

	// Set the filename
	a.download = "GA_" + document.qname["query-name"].value + "_at_" + Date() + ".csv";

	// Hide the 'loading...' animation and show the download link
	document.getElementById('loading').style.display = 'none';
	document.getElementById('loading').innerHTML = '';
	clearInterval(loader);
	a.style.display = 'inline';
	}
</pre>
	<p>Next, the blockquote for highlighting profound passages of prose:</p>
	<blockquote>"This is the day of dramatisation. Merely stating a truth isn't enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will too if you want attention."</blockquote>
	<p>Next let's take a look at lists...</p>
</div></section>
<hr>
<section class="pale-bg"><div class="wrap">
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Support for the <code>::marker</code> pseudo-element would be cool because, although you can style list items with images, you can't format the list markers as text with CSS. For example, I'd like the bullets and numbers to be coloured purple-is this possible?</p>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="box-33">
			<h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
			<p>A one, a two, a-</p>
			<ol>
				<li>One</li>
				<li>Two</li>
				<li>Three</li>
				<li>Four</li>
			</ol>
			<p>I do enjoy a good, numerical list. So orderly and numbered.</p>	
		</div>		
		<div class="box-33">
			<h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
			<p>Never gonna:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Give you up</li>
				<li>Let you down</li>
				<li>Run around</li>
				<li>Desert you</li>
			</ul>
			<p>I do enjoy a good, bullet-pointed list. So free and unordered.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-33">
			<h3>Definition Lists</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>What is love?</dt>
				<dd>Baby don't hurt me.</dd>
			</dl>

				<dt>Won't you take me to?</dt>
